# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview
THe purpose of this project is to identify employees that will soon be retiring from Hewlett Packard. We can use this information to prepare for the many job openings that will begin to appear as baby boomers exit the workforce. We will do this using a PotgreSQL database of employee information. 

## Results
- The impact of the amount of retirees can potentially be massive, with losses of over 90,000 employees
- Nearly two thirds of these employees come from senior engineer's and staff. 
- The mentor program in its current form will not have enough remaining staff to mentor all of the incoming employees. 
- Expanding the range of eligibility will somewhat mitigate this issue, but the difference between mentors and the amount leaving is still massive. 


## Retiring Employees and Mentors

Here we can see the total of retiring employees per position on the left, and the number of mentors per position on the right. 
Just looking at Engineer, which is one of the lower number of potential openings, we see that the company would need 21 mentees per mentor. This number is quite high and can see diminishing value of skills gained from these mentees. The highest of these categories is Senior Engineer which would have a ratio of 55 mentors to mentees. 

If we expand mentor eligibility by two years we can get better resutls, but not quite good enough.

Pictured above we see the same comparision but with wider range of mentor eligibility. Using this age range we run the risk of losing too many employees to the mentorship program so there would clearly need to be some middle ground needed. 


## Conclusion
Realistically not all of these employees will be retiring, and not all of the eligible mentors in the expanded selection would have the desire to step back and mentor, so this problem may not be as bad as it appears initally. To come to a definite conclusion we would have to do more research. Using the current analysis we can only come to the conclusion that Hewlett Packard is not ready for the impending exit of baby boomers from the workforce.
